                                <p>Doctor acknowledges that the nature of her services to be rendered necessitates that these services be performed on the premises of the Client. Doctor may, at her own discretion, provide and utilize any implements or supplies necessary to render services in keeping with the standards of the professional community or she may lease same from Client.</p>
                                <h5>Project Schedule</h5>
                                <p>Doctor shall provide these services on the dates and times set forth in the services schedule attached hereto and as updated from time to time by agreement of both parties.</p>
